        <div class="about_me">
            <p>I'm currently 21 and live in VA! Between 4th Grade and 9th I was a part time actor working at a local dinner theater. One of my favortie productions I was apart of
                was Pocahontas where I played the part of Brave Eagle (In story the little brother of Pocahontas but was an actual person from the same tribe!). After I became a 
                member of the drumline at my highschool where I spent all four years on snare drum and my last 2 years as the Captain. I moved on to Howard University for a semester
                where I got to play in the 2021 Biden Inaguration!
